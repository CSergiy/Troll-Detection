## About

The Troll-Detection project aims to mitigate the harmful effects of "trolls" on online social platforms through the application of data analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can efficiently identify troll posts by examining their content. Additionally, we plan to uncover interconnected networks of troll accounts using graph structure analysis of user interactions.

One of our major concerns is to minimize false positives. In the context of troll detection, falsely categorizing authentic users as trolls could lead to their unjust removal from the platform. This risk is seen as a more significant issue than failing to identify actual troll accounts. Hence, our project's focus is on achieving a balance between accurately detecting trolls and preserving the authentic user experience.

## Dataset

The data for this project is sourced from the ["Tweets Dataset for Detection of Cyber-Trolls"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dataturks/dataset-for-detection-of-cybertrolls) on Kaggle. This dataset contains tweets that have been pre-classified as either aggressive (indicative of trolling) or not.

Our hypothesis is that troll accounts are more likely to be part of a closely interconnected network. By detecting such networks, we aim to enhance the accuracy of troll account detection, consequently making their removal more effective.

Through the analysis of this dataset and the development of a predictive model, our aim is to assist social networks in their continuous battle against disruptive trolling behavior, thereby fostering healthier and more productive online discussions.
