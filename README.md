# About

The Troll-Detection project aims to mitigate the impact of "troll" activity in online social networks through the application of data analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to create a model that not only identifies troll posts by analyzing their textual content but also recognizes clusters of interconnected troll accounts through graph structure analysis of users.

The project utilizes a dataset derived from `data_source`, consisting of various social media posts. Our hypothesis is that troll accounts are more likely to be part of a closely connected network. By detecting such networks, we aim to enhance the accuracy of troll account detection and consequently increase the efficiency of their removal.

In terms of project priorities, we give significant emphasis to reducing false positives. In the context of troll detection, the risk of incorrectly identifying genuine users as trolls, which could potentially result in their unwarranted removal, is perceived as a more significant issue compared to the failure in detecting actual troll accounts. Hence, the project is geared towards creating a balance between accurately detecting trolls and preserving the genuine user experience.
